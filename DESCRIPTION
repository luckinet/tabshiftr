Description: Helps the user to build and register schema descriptions of 
    disorganised (messy) tables. Disorganised tables are tables that are 
    not in a topologically coherent form, where packages such as 'tidyr' could 
    be used for reshaping. The schema description documents the arrangement of 
    input tables and is used to reshape them into a standardised (tidy) output 
    format.
