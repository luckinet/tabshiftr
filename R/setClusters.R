#' Set where the clusters are
#'
#' There is hardly any limit to how data can be arranged in a spreadsheet, apart
#' from the apparent organisation into a lattice of cells. However, it is often
#' the case that data are gathered into topologically coherent chunks. Those
#' chunks are what is called 'cluster' in \code{tabshiftr}.
#' @param schema [\code{schema(1)}]\cr In case this information is added to an
#'   already existing schema, provide that schema here (overwrites previous
#'   information).
#' @param id [\code{character(1)}]\cr When data are clustered, it is typically
#'   the case that the data are segregated according to a categorical variables
#'   of interest. In such cases, this variable needs to be registered as cluster
#'   ID.
#' @param group [\code{character(1)}]\cr When clusters themselves are
#'   clustered, they are typically nested into another categorical variable,
#'   which needs to be registered as group ID.
#' @param left [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The horizontal cell value of the
#'   top-left cell of each cluster. This can also be a vector of values in case
#'   there are several clusters.
#' @param top [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The vertical cell values of the top-left
#'   cell of each cluster. This can also be a vector of values in case there are
#'   several clusters.
#' @param width [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The width of each cluster in cells.
#'   This can also be a vector of values in case there are several clusters.
#' @param height [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The height of each cluster in cells.
#'   This can also be a vector of values in case there are several clusters.
#' @param member [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr For each cluster, specify here to
#'   which group it belongs. Clusters are enumerated from left to right and
#'   from top to bottom.
#' @details Please also take a look at the currently suggested strategy to set
#'   up a \link[=schema]{schema description}.
#' @return An object of class \code{\link{schema}}.
