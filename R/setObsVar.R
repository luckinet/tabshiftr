#' Set an observed variable
#'
#' Observed variables are those variables that contain the (quantitative)
#' observed/measured values of each unique unit (as described by the
#' \code{\link[=setIDVar]{identifying variables}}). There may be several of them
#' and in a tidy table they'd be recorded as separate columns.
#' @param schema [\code{schema(1)}]\cr In case this information is added to an
#'   already existing schema, provide that schema here (overwrites previous
#'   information).
#' @param name [\code{character(1)}]\cr Name of the new measured variable.
#' @param columns [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The column(s) in which the
#'   \emph{values} of the new variable are recorded.
#' @param top [\code{integerish(.)}]\cr In case the variable is nested in a wide
#'   identifying variable, specify here additionally the topmost row in which
#'   the variable \emph{name} sits
#' @param unit [\code{character(1)}]\cr the unit of this variable.
#' @param factor [\code{numeric(1)}]\cr the factor that needs to be multiplied
#'   with the values to convert to \code{unit}, defaults to 1. For instance, if
#'   values are recorded in acres, but shall be recorded in hectare, the factor
#'   would be 0.40468.
#' @param key [\code{integerish(1)}]\cr If the variable is recorded (together
#'   with other variables) so that the variable names are listed in one column
#'   and the respective values are listed in another column, give here the
#'   number of the column that contains the variable names. Can alternatively be
#'   "cluster", in case observed variables are the cluster ID.
#' @param value [\code{character(1)}]\cr If the variable is recorded (together
#'   with other variables) so that the variable names are listed in one column
#'   and the respective values are listed in another column, give here the level
#'   in the names column that refer to the values of this variable.
#' @param relative [\code{logical(1)}]\cr whether or not the values provided in
#'   \code{columns} and \code{rows} are relative to the cluster position(s) or
#'   whether they refer to the overall table.
#' @param distinct [\code{logical(1)}]\cr Whether or not the variable is
#'   distinct from a cluster. This is the case when the variable is recorded
#'   somewhere 'on the side' and thus not explicitly included in all clusters.
#' @details Please also take a look at the currently suggested strategy to set
#'   up a \link[=schema]{schema description}.
#' @return An object of class \code{\link{schema}}.
