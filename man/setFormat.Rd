\title{Set the specific format of a table}
\usage{
setFormat(
  schema = NULL,
  header = 0L,
  decimal = NULL,
  thousand = NULL,
  na_values = NULL,
  flags = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{schema}{[\code{schema(1)}]\cr In case this information is added to an
already existing schema, provide that schema here (overwrites previous
information).}

\item{header}{[\code{integerish(1)}]\cr The number of header rows. Optimally,
a table is read so that column names are ignored (for example
\code{readr::read_csv(file = ..., col_names = FALSE)}). If relatively well
defined tables are processed, where the header is always only one row, the
table can be read in with the default and the header can be spliced into
the table by specifying the number of rows here.}

\item{decimal}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr The symbols that should be
interpreted as decimal separator.}

\item{thousand}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr The symbols that should be
interpreted as thousand separator.}

\item{na_values}{[\code{character(.)}]\cr The symbols that should be
interpreted as \code{NA}.}

\item{flags}{[\code{data.frame(2)}]\cr The typically character based flags
that should be shaved off of observed variables to make them identifiable
as numeric values. This must be a data.frame with two columns with names
\code{flag} and \code{value}.}

\value{
An object of class \code{\link{schema}}.

\description{
Any table makes some assumptions about the data, but they are mostly not
explicitly recorded in the commonly available table format. This concerns,
for example, the symbol(s) that signal "not available" values or the symbol
that is used as decimal sign.
