\usage{
setIDVar(
  schema = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  type = "character",
  value = NULL,
  columns = NULL,
  rows = NULL,
  split = NULL,
  merge = NULL,
  distinct = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{schema}{[\code{schema(1)}]\cr In case this information is added to an
already existing schema, provide that schema here (overwrites previous
information).}

\item{name}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr Name of the new identifying variable.}

\item{type}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr data type of the new identifying
variable. Possible values are \code{"c/character"}, \code{"i/integer"},
\code{"n/numeric"}, \code{"l/logical"}, \code{"D/date"} or \code{"_/skip"}.}

\item{value}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr In case the variable is an implicit
variable (i.e., which is not in the origin table), specify it here.}

\item{columns}{[\code{integerish(.)}]\cr The column(s) in which the
\emph{values} of the new variable are recorded.}

\item{rows}{[\code{integerish(.)}]\cr In case the variable is in several
columns, specify here additionally the row in which the \emph{names} are
recorded.}

\item{split}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr In case the variable is part of a
compound value, this should be a regular expression that splits the
respective value off of that compound value. See
\code{\link[tidyr]{extract}} on how to set up the regular expression.}

\item{merge}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr In case a variable is made up of
several columns, this should be the character string that would connect the
two columns (e.g., an empty space \code{" "}).}

\item{distinct}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr whether or not the variable is
distinct from a cluster. This is the case when the variable is not
systematically available for all clusters and thus needs to be registered
separately from clusters.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{schema}}.
}
\description{
Identifying variables are those variables that describe the (qualitative)
properties that make each observation (as described by the
\code{\link[=setObsVar]{observed variables}}) unique.

\details{
Please also take a look at the currently suggested strategy to set
  up a \link[=schema]{schema description}.
